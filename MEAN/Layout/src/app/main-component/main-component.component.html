<p>We can actually create multiple modules in our Angular application, and they offer us a type of namespacing and division within our application. This becomes more important as our application size increases. For now, we will continue to use the default, initial App Module, just be aware that you could create sub modules that only load based on certain situations (routing to the view, or otherwise).</p>
